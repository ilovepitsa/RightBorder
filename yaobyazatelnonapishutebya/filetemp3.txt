Take me  home
   Take me  home
   It's the one 
 place I can rest 
 in peace
   Turn off my 
 phone
   So many 
 messages I wish I 
could just  delete
   Questioning my 
 existence
   Questioning my 
 decisions
   Burning down 
 all the  bridges
   Dig a  moat
   Now I'm 
 finished
   Sorry don't 
 want you to 
 visit, no, no
   One last pic 
 and I'll be  gone
   Make it  count
    Put the flash 
 on
   Never really 
 felt like I 
 belonged
   So I'll be on 
 my way
   And I won't be 
 long
   I'll be dead by 
 dawn
   I'll be dead by 
 dawn
   I'll be dead by 
 dawn
   I'll be dead by 
 dawn
    Scrolling 
 through my  texts
   Shit I left 
 unread
   Never tryna 
 deal with it
   There's bliss 
 up in my 
 ignorance
   10 dope dealers 
 Ex want me to see 
 her Can't trust 
 her Don't 
    believe her 
 Reply turn into a 
 needle, yeah 
 Don't wanna do it 
 again Got shit 
 I'm not tryna 
 relive Head 
 fucked up and I'm 
 sick These old 
 habits will kill 
 me quick Quicker 
 than I can blink 
 Quicker than I 
 can think Lift me 
 up Don't want 
 sink Pour me up I 
 need a drink What 
 the fuck do I do 
 when sabotage is 
 all I know? Oh, I 
 done dug myself 
 my own grave in 
 this hole, oh no, 
 whoa Kill me 
 slow, slow 
 Curtains close 
 slow Fuck, I 
 don't see what's 
 the point of 
 going on, no
